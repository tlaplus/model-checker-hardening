The diagram draws 3 of 15 relations; the table lists them all.

| Direction | Relation | Type | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| → | uses | [CheckRequest](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.CheckRequest.md) | What a checker is asked about one assembled module. |
| → | uses | [ToolInput](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.ToolInput.md) | One rendered specification and what the receiving checker is asked about it. |
| → | uses | [ToolResult](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.ToolResult.md) | One request result returned by an isolated tool worker. |
| → | depends | [CheckerFailureCode](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.checker.CheckerFailureCode.md) | Stable failure codes shared by model-checker stages. |
| → | depends | [ExplorationCount](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.checker.ExplorationCount.md) | A counted exploration metric. |
| → | depends | [ExplorationMetrics](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.checker.ExplorationMetrics.md) | What a model checker explored to reach its verdict, as ADR 0008 defines it. |
| → | depends | [ExplorationPhase](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.checker.ExplorationPhase.md) | How far a model checker got before its verdict was fixed. |
| → | depends | [WorkflowException](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.WorkflowException.md) | Reports an infrastructure or lifecycle failure in a fuzzing workflow. |
| → | depends | [StageOutcome](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.StageOutcome.md) | Common result of processing one input in a checking stage. |
| ← | depends | [SpecText](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.spec.SpecText.md) | Renders an assembled module as the TLA+ source that the parser and TLC consume. |
| ← | depends | [IsolatedWorkerProcess](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.IsolatedWorkerProcess.md) | Parent-side supervisor for one isolated Java tool worker. |
| ← | depends | [ToolWorkerConnection](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.ToolWorkerConnection.md) | Child-side connection to the parent's private worker-protocol listener. |
| ← | depends | [ToolWorkerRuntime](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.ToolWorkerRuntime.md) | The part of a child worker that is the same for every tool: report an escaped failure by exiting non-zero, announce itself to the parent, serve inputs until the parent stops asking, write each input where the tool reads it, and keep a bounded record of what the tool printed. |
| ← | depends | [WorkerChannel](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.WorkerChannel.md) | The parent's end of one worker's control channel: message framing, and the deadline every read runs under. |
| ← | depends | [WorkerOutput](io.github.tlaplus.hardening.workflow.worker.WorkerOutput.md) | Everything a child process says outside the control channel, and the scratch tree it says it in. |
